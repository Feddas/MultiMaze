# bugs to fix
Hard to repoduce: allow using hold to restart button after it's already been used to regen a maze

# to do AKA stuff you'll see happen with support
- Rotate or Animate Cube size from huge to small to show where the "green pad" is.
- colored "been there" trails.
   - create a cube line behind the player
   - to insure cubes aren't made when player is idle: only draw cube if last distance - current distance > some number
- Resize walls and camera bounds to match x,y size of Maze.
- Handicap: AKA let the unskilled have a chance against the skilled.
   - set movement speed for player so different players move at different speeds
- Keep score. keep track of how often a color has won.

# to do web version
- use WASD, arrow keys, mouse and a gamepad to control 4 players
