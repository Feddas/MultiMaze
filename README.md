# How-To: get the Free version!
We know everyone can't afford the $0.99 paid version. Never fear, we have options so you can play the full game for free! Getting the free version entails you either:

1. Get a pre-built copy from a pirate. Arrr! (may contain viruses)
*or*
2. Play the [WebGL version](http://shawn.featherly.net/MultiMaze/WebGL/) (runs slow)
*or*
3. Compile a copy using the source code. Here are the steps to building a complete version. Takes about 3 hours to do.

   1. [1/2 hr] Download and install the free version of Unity 5.x
   2. [1 hr] Setup Unity to export to your device of choice. (Android requires installing the Android SDK)
   3. [1/2 hr] Download this source code from GitHub and make sure it runs in Unity
   4. (optional) fix code in the game for parts you think suck.
   5. [1/2 hr] Build for your device of choice.
   6. [1/2 hr] Send and install the build on your device. For Android the easiest way is to email the *.apk to an email account you have on the device.

# How-To: support development

1. Get the paid version! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ShawnFeatherly.MultiMaze
2. Play it with friends. Convincing them to play it once on your device is enough to help spread the word.

Here's [some of the things you'll see if you support development](https://github.com/Feddas/MultiMaze/blob/master/Development.md).
